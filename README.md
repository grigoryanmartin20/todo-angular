# Todo Angular

A simple todo application built with Angular that uses local browser storage to save and manage todos. This app allows you to create, edit, delete, and mark todos as complete, with all data persisted locally in your browser's storage.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Create new todos
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit existing todos
- üóëÔ∏è Delete todos
- ‚úÖ Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- üíæ Automatic local storage persistence
- üì± Responsive design
- üé® Clean and modern UI

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) (version 20.3.3 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-angular
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.3.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can:

1. **Add a new todo**: Type your task in the input field and press Enter or click the Add button
2. **Mark as complete**: Click the checkbox next to any todo to mark it as complete
3. **Edit a todo**: Click on the todo text to edit it inline
4. **Delete a todo**: Click the delete button (üóëÔ∏è) next to any todo
5. **View all todos**: All your todos are automatically saved and will persist between browser sessions

## Data Storage

This application uses the browser's `localStorage` API to persist your todos. This means:
- Your todos are saved locally on your device
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No server or database required
- Data is private to your browser

## Technologies Used
